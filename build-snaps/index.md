## Install snapcraft

`snapcraft` is the tool to create snaps. It's available on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and above. To install it, simply run:

    sudo apt install snapcraft

It will also install and run on any Linux distribution using an up-to-date version of [LXD, the container hypervisor](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/lxd).

### Build your first snap

A concise, step by step, snap example is the best way to get started! Heads on to [Your first snap](/docs/build-snaps/your-first-snap).

### Automatically building from Git

You can set up your repository to automatically produce and publish snaps using [these instructions](/docs/build-snaps/ci-integration).

### Building from Ubuntu 14.04
