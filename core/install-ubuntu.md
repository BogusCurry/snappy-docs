title: Install snapd on Ubuntu
---

Ubuntu includes snapd by default starting with the 16.04 (xenial) release. No
further manual steps are required and you can use snapd directly.

For the older 14.04 (trusty) release or any flavour (e.g. Lubuntu) which doesn't
include snapd by default you have to install snapd manually from the archive:

```
$ sudo apt install snapd
```

Afterwards everything is setup to get you started with snaps.
